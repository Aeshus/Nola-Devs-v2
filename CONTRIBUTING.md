### Contribution Protocol:

_we use a [forkless/trunk feature-branch hybrid git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)_

- ðŸŒŸStar the repository :)
- ðŸ“ŒClone down the organization's repo as your `origin` ("the trunk" | "the org repo" | "org remote" | "origin")
- ðŸ“ŒFind a "Feature" from our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Nola-Devs/projects/1) that you would like to work on
  - Inside that "Feature Board" will be "Tickets" (Issues) to pick up. If you have a suggestion open a [new Issue](https://github.com/Nola-Devs/Nola-Devs-v2/issues/new/choose) with the Issue Template provided
  - Assign yourself to the ticket and move it into the "In Progress" lane inside it's respective "Feature Board"
  - Create a branch directly from that ticket's full view on GitHub<sup>see diagram 1.0 - 1.2</sup>
- ðŸ“ŒFetch from `origin main` (paste what you copied) in your IDE and checkout your new feature-branch which should share the same name as the issuing ticket
- ðŸ“ŒUse [Semantic Commit-Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) for feature development
- ðŸ“ŒPush your feature-branch to the trunk remote `git push origin feature/ticket-branch`
- ðŸ“ŒPR to main for Code Review
  - We will review <= 48 hours
- ðŸŽ‡Merge your approved PR branch to main or revise and repeat

**Thank you for your interest in building a tool for the Greater New Orleans Tech community.**

**Your invaluable help is going towards a resource that helps hundreds of people in our community (each month) discover local events for edification, skill sharing, networking, and friend making.**

_if that isn't enough to give you a sense of pride in your contributions, engaging in the codebase and workflow we have established is a great way to **learn professional DevOps practices**, **experience working with modern technologies and languages** (such as Svelte/Sveltekit) and **pushing code contributions into a live application with hundreds of monthly users**; following rolling patches, feature development, live bug fixes and end-user requests._

### Thank you for supporting our flourishing local tech community in New Orleans ðŸ’œðŸ’›ðŸ’š
